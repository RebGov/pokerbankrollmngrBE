**Ante UP Poker Bankroll Suite** (Not a Gaming Site) 
is a tool built to help a poker player (user) to create his/her personal ledger of game play statistics (time in/out; money in/out; location; type of game, etc). Using this information, statistics are performed by the application, such as: duration of game play, number of games played in total, wins vs losses, rate of win/loss over time played. The back end filters throught the game options (type, location, blinds, kill-pot) as well as date to give user ability to see statistics from every angle. Calculations done before storing a user entry to database are: total minutes played, profit of entry, and whether game won or lost. 

Current Deliverables:
- Creating and persisting user account
- Creating and persisitng game types, location (poker room), blind types, kill statuses
- Creating and persisiting user entry of game data
Deliverables in progress:
 - Edit and Delete Options for each create and persist data above
 - revamping database storage of game type, location, blinds, and kill status
Future Deliverables:
 - Tournament Game Data storage and statistics
 - Ability to store "live" sessions

Application currently designed for web use and is under construction as further deliverables, such as turning into a phone application, are being developed.
